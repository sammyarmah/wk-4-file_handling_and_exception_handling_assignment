# 📝 File Read & Write Challenge + 🧪 Error Handling Lab

Welcome to this mini-project! 🚀
This project demonstrates how to **read from a file**, **write a modified version** to a new file, and **handle errors** when working with user input.

---

## 📂 Project Overview

### 1. **File Read & Write Challenge 🖋️**

* Reads the contents of an existing file.
* Modifies the content (for example, converting text to uppercase ✨).
* Writes the modified content into a new output file.

### 2. **Error Handling Lab 🧪**

* Asks the user for a filename.
* Handles errors if:

  * ❌ The file does not exist.
  * ❌ The file cannot be read.
* Ensures the program doesn’t crash and gives helpful feedback instead.

---

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. The program prompts the user:
   👉 *"Enter the filename you want to read:"*

2. If the file exists ✅, it will:

   * Read the content.
   * Modify it (example: uppercase transformation).
   * Save the modified content to a **new file** (e.g., `output.txt`).

3. If the file doesn’t exist ❌, it will:

   * Display a friendly error message with guidance.

---

## 🖥️ Example Run

```
Enter the filename you want to read: input.txt  
✅ File found! Reading content...  
✅ Content modified and saved to output.txt  
```

If the file doesn’t exist:

```
Enter the filename you want to read: missing.txt  
⚠️ Error: File 'missing.txt' not found. Please try again.
```

## 📜 Key Concepts Practiced

* File I/O (📖 Reading & ✍️ Writing).
* Error handling with **try-except** in Python.
* User interaction with input prompts.

---

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone this repository or download the files.
2. Make sure you have Python installed 🐍.
3. Run the program in your terminal:

```bash
python file_challenge.py
```

4. Follow the prompts and test with your own text files!

Would you like me to also **add the actual Python script code** (`file_challenge.py`) that goes with this README, so you have a complete mini-project?
